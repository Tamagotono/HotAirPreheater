Hot Air Preheater

**** SOFTWARE ****
Software is based off of the "Reflowduino" sketch found on adafruit's github 
https://github.com/adafruit/Reflowduino written by PaintYourDragon.

Some portions were also taken from Scott Dixon's hotplate sketch 
http://dorkbotpdx.org/blog/scott_d/temperature_controller_board_final_design

The Encoder library is written by Paul Stoffregen <paul@pjrc.com>
http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html
I chose this library because it allows use of 0,1 or 2 interupt pins for maximum flexability

The MAX6675 library is also taken from adafruit's github
https://github.com/adafruit/MAX6675-library

The RESET function was taken directly from the following website:
http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1222941939/12

The rest are standard Arduino 1.0 librarys.

**** HARDWARE ****
Rev 0.01
The hardware is currently a kludge of Scott Dixon's hotplate PCB with a second MAX6675 chip
stacked on top of the original, with pins 3 & 6 bent out and wired separately.  Pin 3 is
the input for the second TC and Pin 6 is the CS and wired to DP4.



NOTE: While researching temperature profiles, I found where it was suggested
	to tap the reflow oven after the solder has melted, to allow it to 
	settle into proper alignment.  I am considering adding a small, cellphone 
	vibrator to the base of the board support arms and having it kick on automatically
	for a few pulses to perform this task.  Not sure if this is a good idea or not.
	I guess I will have to experiment with this after the rest of the unit is finished.
